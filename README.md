# PLATYPUS Compiler Project.

Introduction During the course of a semester at Algonquin college in the CST8152 Compilers class, I built the front end of a compiler to process a custom language designed by our professor, Svillen Ranev. This was a project in which I learnt about and applied knowledge associated with:

1.) Describe the nature of a programming language and the process of converting a program written in a highlevel
programming language into executable code.
  - identify the theoretical and practical differences between existing programming paradigms and
    programming languages;
  - describe the function and the operation of editors, preprocessors, code generators, code optimizers,
    librarians, linkers, and other compiler supporting tools;
  - describe the function and the operation of the building blocks of Integrated Development Environments;
  - explain the how and when different compiler outputs and run-time environments are used. Detail the
    difference between compiler and interpreter.
    
2.) Explain the process of compiling a computer program and the parts of a compiler.
  - identify the main building blocks of a compiler and an interpreter;
  - explain the role of the lexical analyzer (scanner), syntax analyzer (parser), code optimizer, and code
    generator.
    
3.) Differentiate the process of and the tools for lexical analysis, parsing, error handling, and interpretation.
  - explain the main characteristics of a programming language and how it relates to a natural language;
  - identify and describe the different techniques and tools used for lexical, syntactical, and semantic analysis
    of a program written in specific language.
    
4.) Understand regular expressions and basic programming and scripting language grammars.
  - identify the role of the descriptive notations like regular expressions and grammars to describe a
    programming or scripting language;
  - use regular expressions to define the lexical part of a programming language;
  - use BNF grammar to define the syntactical part of a programming language;
  - implement a lexical analyzer (scanner) based on regular expressions;
  - use syntax-directed translation approach to implement a syntax analyzer (parser) based on a grammar
    description.
    
5.) Build and manage a mid-size programming project.
  - use the C programming language to write a complex program implementing the front end of a compiler;
  - use different compiler platforms to write effective, compact androbust multi-file programs;
  - coordinate properly the compilation and linking of multiple files containing local, static and global data
    structures and functions;
  - build code for modification and re-use applying modularity and defensive rogramming.
  - select and use appropriate tools and technology for building a project.

# Here you will find implementation of compiler components.

  Assignemnt 1: Buffer
 
  Assignemnt 2: Scanner
 
In Scanner you will find PLATYPUS Language Specification and Informal Language Specification
 
  Assignment 3: Symbol Table
 
  Assignment 4: Parser

In Parser you will find PLATYPUS Language grammar transformed into Recursive Descent Predictive Parsing (LL grammar).
